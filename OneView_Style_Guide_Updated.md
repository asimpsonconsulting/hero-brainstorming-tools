backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
```

**Glass TOC Panel:**
```css
background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
```

#### **Dark Theme Gradients**
- **Headlines:** linear-gradient(135deg, #ffffff 0%, #f97316 100%)
- **Alternative Headlines:** Solid #ffffff (better readability option)
- **CTA Buttons:** Maintain same brand gradients (sufficient contrast on dark)

### Multi-Theme Design Strategy
**Theme Usage:**
- **Light Theme:** Primary website, standard testing (Parts 1 & 2)
- **Dark Theme:** Advanced testing environment (Part 3 - The Lab only)

**Design Approach:**
1. **Start with light theme** messaging validation
2. **Test dark theme** readability and impact
3. **Compare side-by-side** for optimal contrast
4. **Maintain brand consistency** across both themes

### Color Usage Guidelines
**DO:**
- **Test all colors on both light AND dark backgrounds**
- **Use glass effects** for overlays on dark themes
- **Maintain brand orange** (#f97316) as accent across light/dark themes
- **Use rgba with low opacity** for dark theme cards/panels
- **Apply backdrop-filter: blur()** for modern glass effects
- Use gradient backgrounds for primary actions and brand elements
- Maintain WCAG AA accessibility standards (contrast ratio 4.5:1+)
- Use consistent color coding for performance metrics and UI states
- Apply gradients to text using `bg-clip-text text-transparent`

**DON'T:**
- Use pure gradients for headlines on dark backgrounds (readability concerns)
- Apply same contrast ratios from light to dark (adjust accordingly)
- Forget to test CTA button readability on various dark backgrounds
- Use solid blacks/whites without considering glass effects
- Use flat brand colors when gradients are available for primary elements
- Apply gradients to small text (under 18px)
- Mix warm and cool gradients in the same visual hierarchy level
- Use more than 2 gradients in a single component

### Accessibility Notes
We target WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 contrast ratio). **Important:** Gradient text and backgrounds require per-component validation with a contrast checker, as gradient angles and color stops can affect readability. Gray text colors are pre-validated for white backgrounds.

**Dark Theme Accessibility:**
- **White text on #1a1a1a:** 15.3:1 contrast ratio (AAA compliant)
- **Orange (#f97316) on dark:** Sufficient for accent use
- **Glass effects:** Test readability case-by-case
- **Custom dark colors:** Require contrast validation with tools

## 8. Voice & Tone

### Brand Voice
Our voice is consistent across all communications. We are:

**Analytically Precise:** We base all recommendations on data and measurable outcomes
- *In practice: "Teams see 34% higher close rates when capacity is allocated to high-intent prospects" not "Our solution improves results"*

**Empowerment-Focused:** We help teams achieve success, positioning them as the hero of their story
- *In practice: "Your team deserves tools that amplify their strengths" not "Our platform is the best"*

**Clarity-Driven:** We explain complex GTM concepts in accessible, actionable language
- *In practice: "Engagement capacity is how much meaningful outreach your team can handle" not "Leverage synergistic touchpoint optimization"*

**Results-Oriented:** We emphasize tangible outcomes and transformations
- *In practice: "Transform scattered efforts into 40% more qualified pipeline" not "Enhance your sales methodology"*

### Tone Variations by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Hero Headlines | Confident, transformation-focused | "Turn the lights on with capacity optimization insights" |
| Error messages | Helpful, solution-oriented | "Let's get this fixed. Try uploading your file again or contact our team." |
| Success messages | Celebratory but professional | "Analysis complete! Your capacity insights are ready to review." |
| Help documentation | Clear, step-by-step instructional | "To upload your data: 1) Export from your CRM 2) Upload the CSV file..." |
| Social media | Thoughtful, industry-focused | "Pipeline performance isn't just about more leads—it's about capacity optimization." |
| Sales pages | Confident, value-focused | "See exactly where your pipeline bottlenecks occur and how to fix them" |

### Voice Examples

**✅ On-Brand:**
- "Every seller has limits. Every AI has constraints. Every system has finite capacity. Success comes from investing that precious capacity wisely."
- "We help companies maximize returns on pipeline generation efforts by optimizing their most precious resource: Engagement Capacity."
- "Identify which prospects deserve your team's limited attention with data-driven capacity allocation."

**❌ Off-Brand:**
- "Leverage cutting-edge AI to synergize your sales operations and disrupt traditional methodologies" (too corporate/buzzwordy)
- "Our revolutionary platform will transform your entire business overnight" (overpromising/ego-focused)
- "Click here to learn more about our amazing features and solutions" (vague/feature-focused)

---

## 9. Writing Guidelines

### General Writing Principles

1. **Clarity First**
   - Write for busy executives—be concise but comprehensive
   - Use short sentences (15-20 words average)
   - Break up long paragraphs (3-4 sentences maximum)
   - Lead with the most important information

2. **Active Voice**
   - ✅ Good: "Optimize your engagement capacity with data-driven insights"
   - ❌ Avoid: "Your engagement capacity can be optimized through our data-driven insights"

3. **User-Focused Language**
   - Use "you" and "your" to address users directly
   - Focus on user outcomes and transformations, not just features
   - ✅ Good: "Identify which prospects deserve your team's limited attention"
   - ❌ Avoid: "Our AI-powered prospect scoring algorithm uses machine learning"

4. **Industry Credibility**
   - Use proper GTM and sales operations terminology correctly
   - Reference specific metrics and benchmarks when possible
   - Demonstrate deep understanding of B2B sales challenges

### Punctuation & Formatting

**Capitalization:**
- Use sentence case for headings and UI elements
- Product names: "OneView" (one word), "OneView Labs"
- Proper nouns: "Engagement Capacity" (our framework)

**Numbers:**
- Spell out numbers one through nine in body copy
- Use numerals for 10 and above, percentages, metrics, and data
- Format large numbers: 10k, 1.2M (not 10,000 or 1,200,000)

**Lists:**
- Use bullets for unordered benefits or features
- Use numbers for sequential steps or processes
- Keep list items parallel in structure and length

**Contractions:**
- Allowed in conversational contexts (web copy, social media)
- Avoid in formal documentation or help content
- Approved: don't, can't, won't, you're, we're, it's

### Industry Terminology

**Canonical Definition (Use Consistently):**
**Engagement Capacity:** The measurable amount of meaningful prospect/customer interactions your GTM team can execute in a given time period—at the quality level required to move pipeline. It combines headcount, tooling effectiveness, data quality, SLAs, and strategic prioritization.

**Always Use (OneView Terms):**
- **Engagement Capacity** (not "bandwidth" or "capacity")
- **Pipeline Performance** (not "sales effectiveness" or "conversion rates")
- **GTM Operations** (not "sales and marketing alignment")
- **Capacity Optimization** (not "efficiency improvement")
- **Status Quo Gap** (when discussing current solution limitations)

**Avoid:**
- Generic business speak: "synergy," "leverage," "circle back," "deep dive"
- Overused SaaS terms: "game-changing," "revolutionary," "cutting-edge," "next-generation"
- Weak qualifiers: "very," "really," "quite," "amazing," "incredible"
- Negative constructions: "Don't miss out" → "Secure your spot"

### Calls-to-Action (CTAs)

**Primary CTA Patterns:**
- **Assessment/Analysis:** "Start Your Analysis," "Begin Assessment," "Get Your Capacity Report"
- **Demo/Trial:** "See It in Action," "Watch Demo," "Experience the Platform"
- **Consultation:** "Book Strategy Call," "Get Expert Review," "Schedule Consultation"

**Button Text Guidelines:**
- Use action verbs with clear outcomes
- Be specific about what happens next
- Keep to 2-4 words when possible
- Always indicate value or next step

**CTA Mapping by Funnel Stage:**
- **TOFU (Awareness):** "See It in Action" → ungated demo/video
- **MOFU (Consideration):** "Start Your Analysis" → interactive assessment/audit
- **BOFU (Decision):** "Book Strategy Call" → calendar booking

**✅ Good CTA Examples:**
- "Start Free Trial" (clear action + benefit)
- "Get Your Report" (specific outcome)
- "Book Strategy Call" (clear next step)

**❌ Avoid:**
- "Submit" (unclear outcome)
- "Click Here" (no value indication)
- "Learn More" (vague)
- "Get Info" (not specific enough)
